# Dashboard
Simple dashboard application for the occasional devops.

## Motivation
This is intended as a showcase application for a `react` + `electron` architecture.

## Scripts
```yarn start``` will start the Electron app and the React app at the same time.  
```yarn build``` will build the React app and package it along the Electron app.

## Thanks
Inspired by [@kitze's cra + electron](https://github.com/kitze/react-electron-example). Many thanks! Great work üëè.
